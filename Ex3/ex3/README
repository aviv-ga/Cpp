* The eigen library is much better than my own implementation for add and mult operation between matrices.
In my opinion the main difference is the fact that I used trivial algorithms for the operation, while there
are much faster and clever algorithms.


* The difference between mult and add operation is by its asymptotic runtime.
My mult implementation has O(n^3) runtime, whereas my add implementation has O(n*m) runtime.
